1 - Class FDependencyList
	(Refactor: Move the computation methods outside the class)
	
1.1 - Class FDComputation
	+ computeKeys(self)
	
2 - Class Relation:
	- name
	- attributes
	- domain
	- keys
	- fds
	- inclusion dep
	- minimalcover
	- user_FD : a  FDependencyList object with the user defined FDs
	- NF : the NF in which the relation is (fds + user_FDs)
	- NF2_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- NF3_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- BCNF_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- Calls to the methods in NFComputation and SQLParser
	
2.1 - Class NFComputation
	+ checkNormalForm(): wrapper
		+ checkNF2(): checks if the relation is in NF2
		+ checkNF3(): checks if the relation is in NF3
		+ checkBCNF(): checks if the relation is in BCNF
		
2.2 - Class SQLParser
	+ importSchema: function that connects and reads the schema of a DB and returns a list of Relation objects
	+ createSQL : SQL table creation statement
	
2.3- class Normalization
	+ proposeNorm: function that will propose normalization and returns the normalized relations based on the computation of NFComputation
		+ NF2Decomposition: propose normalization in NF2
		+ NF3Decomposition: ""
		+ BCNFDecomposition: ""
2.4- class XMLImEx
	+ importSchema2XML: import the FDs and Schema to XML
	+ importSchemaFromRelation: import the schema from relation and write to a xml file
